### 1. Use the modeling techniques you learned, to train a model such as :

to tell [西瓜甜度](https://github.com/tz28/machine-learning/blob/master/%E8%A5%BF%E7%93%9C%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%E9%9B%863.0.txt)\
or use our exercise Flight Incident data on a different model (Random Forest, logistic regression, Neural Network)\
or Time series to tell some trend from [BITDB](https://bitdb.network/)

### 2.Use your language, to tell finance managers\
what is RFM model, what is time series model, what is association rule, what is KNN method.
And RFM's different to Clustering(K-means), KNN's difference to Association rules or Clustering

### 3. Choose 1 item:
A. tell if 林彪's last flight is in our full recordset (18MB), if not, add it and also contribute to the original Kaggle dataset
b. Modify the Kmeans notebook to 3 Dimension data, and display it in quasi-3D chart
c. Complete the Alteryx RFM model or create using another tool
